Subject: Request for Leave of Absence

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to request a leave of absence for three days, from Saturday, [Date] to Sunday, [Date], and Friday, [Date].

I have a prior commitment to attend a family event that has been planned for months, and I have already made arrangements and commitments that I cannot reschedule. This event is of great importance to me and my family, and I believe that it would be extremely difficult for me to fully concentrate on my work duties while being physically and emotionally present.

I understand that my absence may cause some inconvenience to the team, but I have taken steps to ensure that my responsibilities will be covered during my leave. I have already completed all of my urgent tasks and delegated the remaining ones to my colleagues, who are fully capable of handling them in my absence. Additionally, I have made arrangements for my emails and phone calls to be forwarded to a colleague who will be available to assist with any urgent matters.

I am confident that my leave will not negatively impact the team's performance or the company's operations. I have a proven track record of meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations, and I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition during my absence.

I kindly request your approval for this leave of absence. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that I will return to work on [Date] refreshed and ready to continue contributing to the team's success.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
