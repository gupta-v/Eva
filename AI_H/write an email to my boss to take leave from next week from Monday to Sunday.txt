Subject: Request for Leave of Absence (Next Week)

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a leave of absence from next week, starting [Monday, date] through [Sunday, date], for personal reasons.

I understand the importance of my presence in the workplace and have taken steps to ensure my responsibilities are covered during my absence. I have completed all urgent tasks and delegated ongoing projects to my colleagues. I have also made arrangements for them to contact me in case of unexpected issues.

My aim during this leave is to attend to personal matters that require immediate attention. I believe that taking this time off will enable me to resolve these issues and return to work with renewed focus and energy.

I understand and appreciate the impact my absence may have on the team, and I assure you that I will make up for any tasks that fall behind during my leave. I am committed to completing all my duties upon my return.

I have attached a copy of my medical certificate for your reference, confirming the need for this leave. I am available via email and phone during my absence if you need to contact me urgently.

Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your understanding and support. If there is any uncertainty about my responsibilities, please let me know, and I'll provide further clarification.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
